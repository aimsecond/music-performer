This project is aiming to create a new way to make music -- using hand gestures.

---
## First Presentation on May.10

### objective

- Deliver a Android app allowing user to perform music with virtual instruments using non-touch hand gesture
- Implement a hand gesture recognition function to detect/recognize userâ€™s fingers and play related musical sound
- Users are able to create a piece of melody with their hands and record their works

### Project details

- Referenced API/Library include HandWave library, Gesture API with OpenCV, or some other API/Libraries based on machine learning
- Tentative hardware sensors include camera, GPS, proximity sensor, etc.

### Demonstration

- Demo: Live demo on a real phone + pre-recorded demo video
- Worst-case: All the functions will work but may not have a very high accuracy or could not respond quickly.
- Best-case: All the functions work well with accurate gesture recognition, ultra-fast response time. Some other add-ons would also be introduced including practice mode, challenge mode, etc.
